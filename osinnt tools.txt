Here are a few tools for finding these files and types of documents:
https://issuu.com/ - Issuu. This tool allows you to convert PDF files into other formats like Flipbooks, Social Media Posts, Articles, GIFs, and more. You can search files submitted to the site and the search covers the indexed contents of those files as well.

https://lnkd.in/giBcCG-A - SlideShare. This tool allows you to share presentations, slide decks, etc. You can search the files uploaded to the site and the search covers the indexed contents of those files as well.

https://www.scribd.com/ - Scribd. This tool allows you to share documents and is used by everyone from academics to professionals alike. It can contain a variety of documents. You can search the over 175 million documents uploaded to the site and the search covers the indexed contents of those files as well. 

https://www.docdroid.net/ - DocDruid. Allows you to upload and share documents online. It does not have a search engine feature, however, it can be dorked in search engines using the "site:" operator and a match case operator for the term you are trying to find in the documents.

https://www.calameo.com/ - Calameo. Publishing platform for digital magazines, interactive publications and online catalogs. You can search documents uploaded to the site and the search covers the indexed contents of those files as well.



Since we don't know that range, we can find out if a device was or wasn't manufactured by Taser International Inc. using a Bluetooth device address lookup tool:
https://lnkd.in/gzayy5hc - IPNet, 
Bluetooth Device Address (BD_ADDR) Lookup Tool

If you want to give it a try, try looking up this address:
00:25:DF:6C:B8:73

Finally, as I mentioned earlier, using tools like WiGLE you can geolocate the device via its Bluetooth address with the Bluetooth Search feature:
https://lnkd.in/gzCehYV3 - WiGLE Bluetooth Search


Let's use a particularly interesting example from hackers who are using these addresses to detect police: https://lnkd.in/gdG9b7mu

This tool is the most comprehensive online file storage search engine tool I've found. Currently, it allows you to search file hosting services like: Mega, filefactory, depositfiles, easy-share, sharedzilla, gigasize, divshare, sendspace, yousendit, Badongo, Mediafire, Zshare, 4shared, letitbit, drop, filesurf, hotshare, usaupload, savefile, bigupload, up-file, hyperfileshare, zippyshare, uploaded.to, uploading, sharebee, rapidspread, Taringa, and many more with each search query.

https://lnkd.in/gwjf5u9i - NAPALM FTP Indexer, 894,766,414 files (10317.90 TB) in 3,063 FTP servers
https://www.mmnt.ru/int/ - M A M O N T, Total files: 4 Billion

t also supports the following basic Boolean operators: AND, OR, (), "",*

RapidAPI used in an OSINT tool, but I am sure it won't be the last: https://lnkd.in/gCuzarfg - Meta_scan, Facebook Scraping Tool

This tool has a much higher chance of continuing to work, not because it is necessarily better than other tools, but because a third party is being paid to actively maintain a Facebook scrapper and ensure it continues to work. This allows the tool developer to just focus on issues and updates related to the tool and frees them from the cat-and-mouse game with Meta.

Moving forward I am expecting more tool developers to integrate API scrappers instead of creating their own. And, the API developers who maintain these scrappers stand to make a lot of money from them if they can establish themselves as reliable and quick to fix issues.

RapidAPI has a ton of similar scrappers and many other useful APIs for OSINT, give them a look if you are making OSINT products: https://rapidapi.com/hub

Here's a link to the tool:
https://fidigger.com/ - Fidigger 

Here are some useful tools for VK:
https://vk.watch/ - Historical profiles scrapes. See public comments left by an account, profile photos used, demographic information, and more! 
https://lnkd.in/gX4GTGUK - Find VK profiles by face!


You can search OSHA violations easily using the official OSHA tool:
https://lnkd.in/gieZA8Au - Official OSHA search tool

There are two tools for searching this data that I have found so far, they are:
https://lnkd.in/gfRTS2pT - Packet Safari
https://lab.dynamite.ai/ - DynamiteLab


Their data is stored in Web ARChive (WARC) Format. This file format is extremely high fidelity and allows you to view a page as if the page were still live from an archive file.

I've archived an entire online sports profile with hundreds of videos using the file format and some of their open-source tools and I was able to view the profile from the archive as if I was viewing the live page. 

Common Crawl is not as easily accessible as the Internet Archive though, I would highly recommend reading their guide before you get started: https://lnkd.in/gub7Pi8n

Once you are done with that, you can search their index using a URL pattern here and download any data you find using the instructions from the guide: https://lnkd.in/girYSGte

Edit: Here's a guide by my friend Albert Hui on how to download data from CommonCrawl: https://lnkd.in/gCCWjk8V

Techniques:
1. Dorking the Discord Feedback forum could help find posts via someone's Discord username. When you make a post to the forum either as a feature suggestion, feedback post, or comment it includes your Discord username in the post. https://lnkd.in/g4uFE5Ty

2. Join large public Discord servers and search for messages from the target user. You can find large Discord servers using sites like:
